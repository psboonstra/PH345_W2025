-   Choice of projection

-   Web Mercator: up is always north. Distortions lead to risk of misinterpreting geographic area

-   Albers Equal Area preserves geographic area but can distort shape

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the principles of effective and accurate graphical representation of different data types;

2.  To draw conclusions from graphical representations about relationships and trends in variables;

3.  To understand how graphical representations of data can be used to mislead or exaggerate relationships;

4.  To create and improve data visualizations using the R statistical environment;
