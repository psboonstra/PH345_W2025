## Case Study 1

:::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Chloropeth: graduated colors

-   Provinces are different sizes, different populations

-   Comparison across provinces is difficult
:::

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Bar chart of number of cases for each Chinese province

-   Is a map justified?

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Blue replaces red. Less "emotive"

-   Rates replace totals

-   Hubei province rightly set apart from others

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Dots representing 10 cases randomly placed in each province

-   Potential misleading conclusion that Hubei province was overwhelmed

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Totals represented by proportional circles

-   Not adjusted for population

-   All areas represented, e.g. Macau and Hong Kong

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Log-transformed totals

-   Importance of legend

-   Logarithm de-emphasizes extremely large values but risks over-emphasizing small values

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Inappropriate ‘smoothing’ of data based upon geographic center

-   Epicenter (Hubei) is lost

-   Suggests all of eastern China was overwhelmed

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Choice of projection

-   Web Mercator: up is always north. Distortions lead to risk of misinterpreting geographic area

-   Albers Equal Area preserves geographic area but can distort shape

## 

::::: columns

-   Light blue = 2011,2014,or 2017; Dark Blue = 2021

-   How difficult is it to...

    -   ...find specific country?
    -   ...find greatest change?
    -   ...summarize overall changes?
    -   ...precisely report a number?

> Sixty-two percent of the unbanked cited ‘lack of money’ as one of multiple responses (figure 1.2.3). (p35)

-   Plots of proportions should clearly communicate what denominators and numerators are
